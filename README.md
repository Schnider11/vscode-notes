A markdown focused notes extension for Visual Studio Code that takes inspiration from Notational Velocity.

## Features

Notes utilizes a decentralized method for taking notes. Notes are stored in a single location (directory) located anywhere you'd like. Notes are written in Markdown and are stored as **.md** files within the Notes storage directory.

## Getting Started

1. Open the Command Pallet (CMD+Shift+P or CTRL+Shift+P) and execute `Notes: Select location to store notes` to be prompted for a location to store your note (markdown **.md**) files.
2. After you've selected a location to store your notes you can create notes by going to the Command Pallet and selecting `Notes: Create new note`.
3. To view and filter the list of notes that you already have you can go to the Command Pallet and select `Notes: list all notes`.
